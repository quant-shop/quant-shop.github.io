    "title": "The Mathematical Logic of Intersectionality",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The term paradox carries distinct meanings depending on context, but it is fundamentally tied to logic. In formal logic and philosophy, a paradox is generally understood as a self-contradictory statement, or one that runs counter to expectations, exposing problems or limitations in logical systems.\nClassic logical paradoxes, such as the Liar Paradox—“This statement is false”—force reasoners into cycles of contradiction with no clear resolution, prompting the reexamination of axioms and definitions within mathematics and philosophy.\nLogical paradoxes often arise when apparently sound reasoning from plausible premises yields an unacceptable or absurd conclusion, as highlighted in definitions and logical thought experiments.\nIn everyday language and culture, paradoxes often serve a different function: they are used rhetorically or conceptually to highlight complexity, to challenge conventional thinking, or to reveal hidden truths within what appears nonsensical.\nCulturally familiar paradoxes include claims like “less is more,” or strategic dilemmas such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma. In statistics, paradoxes such as Simpson’s Paradox and Abelson’s Paradox demonstrate how aggregated data can reveal trends that are reversed when broken down into subgroups, further exposing the limitations of naive or intuitive reasoning.\nCulturally responsive paradoxes elevate paradox from a mere logical puzzle to a tool for critical social reflection and transformation. Rooted in traditions such as Culturally Responsive Pedagogy and Critical Pedagogy, these paradoxes confront and challenge existing power structures and dominant narratives within education and society. Paulo Freire’s work in critical pedagogy, for example, positioned paradox at the heart of educational practices that question the status quo and engage learners as agents of change. The Black Intellectual Tradition—as described by thinkers like Manning Marable—and intersectional frameworks advanced by Kimberlé Crenshaw offer further layers, making paradox an analytic lens for examining overlapping social categories and injustices.\nIn this way, culturally responsive paradoxes serve not only to confound logic, but to describe, critique, and prescribe new ways of understanding and transforming reality for marginalized communities. They are leveraged to “critically engage and challenge the status quo,” fostering learning environments that are descriptive (documenting lived reality), corrective (addressing historical and contemporary wrongs), and prescriptive (envisioning emancipatory futures). Intersectional and Black feminist critiques spotlight how paradoxes permeate public life where overlapping identities and structural forces create circumstances that seem irreconcilable, yet demand new modes of reasoning and action."

    "section": "Origins",
    "text": "Origins\nThe word abacus dates back to 1387 AD. The Latin form of the word was used to describe a sandboard abacus; this language was derived from abakos, the Greek generative form of abax or abakon, which means “calculating table.” The meaning of abax was varied, and also referred to any table sprinkled with sand and used to draw geometric figures. As a result, the word may be an extension of ābāq (pronounced “a-vak”), which is the Hebrew word for dust; there are also connections to the Phoenician word abak, meaning “sand.” There are disagreements with regard to the plural form of abacus; however, abacuses and abaci are both widely used.\nThe Babylonian cuneiform may be a derived representation of the abacus. But, given the primitive times, Babylonians may have used the abacus for addition and subtraction. The earliest mentions of the use of the abacus date back to ancient Egypt. Abacus-like devices of various sizes, similar to the earlier versions of abaci, were said to be used as counting devices in Ancient Egyptian cultures. However, there is some speculation with regard to the accuracy of these findings based on the lack of evidence in wall depictions and other art widely attributed to Egyptian culture. The oldest counting board discovered to date was found on the Greek island of Salamis, in 1846. This white marble slab measured 149 centimeters in length, 75 centimeters in width, and 4.5 centimeters in height, and it contains five groups of markings. The construction of the markings and lines on this abacus is similar to more modern forms found at later dates, with parallel lines equally dividing up the board. The Roman and Indian abaci were very similar. The Chinese abacus is referred to as the suanpan, and was first referenced in a 1st-century book entitled “Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures,” written by Xu Yue. While the exact design of the suanpan is unknown, it is regarded as a key developmental factor in the modern abacus, particularly as written languages were developed globally. The suanpan was used for additional functions beyond counting, such as multiplication, square root, and cube root operations. The similarity between the Roman and Chinese abacuses implies that one may have informed the other. The use of the abacus in Korea and Japan is closely tied to China. The Native American abacus, called the nepohualtzintzin, was used in ancient Aztec culture. The related system of knotted cords, the quipu, used by the Incas, recorded numerical data similar to the abacus. In Russia, the abacus is called the schoty. It has a similar design to other abaci but uses a single slanted deck to aid the user. It is still in use today as it was in more ancient times, by shopkeepers and in markets. As written calculus became more common, the use of the abacus declined in many countries."

    "text": "Customs\nThe abacus was historically referred to as a counting frame, or calculating table, to denote its function as a tool for conducting arithmetical processes. Its origins are dated prior to any written numerical system, and before the adoption of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. The abacus was most likely invented in Mesopotamia by an ancient group known as the Sumerians. Early abaci were likely flat stone slabs covered with earthy materials, such as pebbles, sand, dust, or mud. Contemporary versions of the abacus are generally constructed as a frame, most often a wooden frame, with an arrangement of beads and rods, or wires. The origin of this modern version is unclear, but is most often attributed to early India or Egypt. China is also said to have played a major role in the development and evolution of the abacus. Merchants and businesspeople in Africa, Asia, the early Americas—specifically the Native Americans—and Russia used abaci most extensively over the course of many centuries.\nThe abacus continues to be used in Africa, China, Japan, and the Middle East. Calculations on the modern abacus are generally performed with beads or counters, instead of numerals. An abacist uses the beads to denote a variety of calculations that signify numbers and place values. Each bead has the same value, and is used to represent numbers based on the place values represented by the wires or rods. Every column represents a different digit. For example, the wire represents a place value—the ones, tens, hundreds, etc. Each bead, then, would represent a specific numerical value within each category. The modern school abacus is generally focused on the representation of place value and numbers."
