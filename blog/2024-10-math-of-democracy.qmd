Shakiyya Bland to Everyone (Oct 28, 2024, 5:30 PM)
Sorry that I need to go to another meeting. Thank you Dr.  Alexander for hosting and thank you Dr. Volic for presenting. I enjoy reading you book. The question that I am reflecting on is, Can democracy thrive without quantitative literacy? In what ways does a lack of mathematical understanding hinder public participation in democratic decision-making?   Take Care!
