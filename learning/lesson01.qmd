## The Quantitative Histories Workshop Model

### Prep

### Analysis

### Reporting

### Case study

To explore this model, we will use a case study. 

Our case study begins with the [Washington Post Fatal Force database](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings){target="_blank"}. Throughout the case study, historical and other contemporary data is combined to generate an original database. This database can be used for your analysis.
