we are a network of collaborative projects. 

we use interdisciplinary perspectives and computational tools to educate ourselves about history.

at our core, we are a computational studies, curriculum and software development lab. 

specifically, we read about and study historical events to aid our group and others learning about in/justice and futurity. we attempt to maintain honest applications of multiple critical theories, and we try to be mindful of the harm of computational and modeling tools when learning about communities and groups. however, we are also excited with how quantitative tools can support how we respond to injustice. 

in that process, we explore and discuss how we act on our new knowledge. 

our work inspires our members to set up community-centered, near-peer research projects and user groups. in these groups, users engage with other members of their teams by creating a set of learning goals to engage in interdisciplinary projects about pressing questions. 

we then hold workshops to invite the public into our learning processes, modeling, and data explorations.

our workshop is inspired by the legacy of the great, late Bob Moses, founder of the [Algebra Project](https://www.algebra.org){target="_blank"}.
