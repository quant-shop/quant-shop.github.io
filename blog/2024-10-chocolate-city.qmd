On October 4th, the Quantitative Histories Workshop partnered with Nubian Hueman in Anacostia, DC to host a #publicmath event focused on the mathematics behind DC's changing demographics. During the event, participants engaged in a host of activities related to gerrymandering, gentrification, and the analysis of U.S. census data on historically Black communities.
