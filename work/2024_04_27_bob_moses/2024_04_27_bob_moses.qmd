## [*Data*]{style="color:darkgreen;"} + Ida B. [*Wells*]{style="color:darkgreen;"}-Barnett

::: {.incremental}

  - We use the term "[Data Wells]{style="color:darkgreen;"}" to describe how we practice the identification, input, and storage of what can be termed as critical insights data, or CIDs.
  
  - We use information in databases in four ways: 
  
    (1) studying problems in the [quantification of historical information]{style="color:red;"} across various axes: time, social constructs, and/or systemic issues, 
    
    (2) data [identification]{style="color:red;"} and [wrangling]{style="color:red;"}, 
    
    (3) data [analysis]{style="color:red;"} and [communication]{style="color:red;"}, and 
    
    (4) [modeling]{style="color:red;"} abstract inquiries.
  
  - We begin our analysis with Ida B. Wells-Barnett's organization and analysis of lynching.
  
  - We describe "Data Wells" of U.S. state violence using quantitative history as a frame.

## Quantitative history

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

  - Quantitative history considers methods and approaches to artifacts as data and information.
  
  - Historians like Pierre Chanu (book to the right) are centered in traditional texts; more traditional perspectives are uncovering troubling practices with regard to race[^chanu].
  
  - Despite many long-standing critiques, there are [fewer critical dimensions]{style="color:orange;"} in [quantitative history] narratives.

## Racialization and U.S. State Violence

Today, we will explore three forms of state sponsored violence.

. . .

  - Lynching 

![Ida B. Wells-Barnett](ida1.jpg){width=50%}

. . .

  - Police

. . .

  - Prisons

## The Red Record

  - **Personal experience**. In 1892, a close friend of Ida B. Wells-Barnett was lynched. Wells-Barnett, a known activist, community organizer, and journalist, would generate quantitative indicators of lynching as state violence.

. . .

  - **Intuition and method**. Like many Black communities at the time and other allies, Wells-Barnett acknowledged both the personal (micro) social forces of racism and the systemic (macro) nature of white racial violence. In this case, this violence was expressed through the practice of lynching.

. . .

  - **Impact**. Wells-Barnett's databases, and the use of number and quantification have a profound impact on the current view of state-sponsored racial violence.

## Lynching

Caitlin Pollock has created [software](https://redrecord.cmjpollock.com/) based on a series of extracted data from Wells-Barnett's work. Although the data provides for quick loading and analysis, it does require some data wrangling.

## Concerns

Pollock deals with the issue of erasure in their development of the data.

## Policing {background-image="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200709194059-09-week-in-photos-0710.jpg?q=w_1480,c_fill" background-opacity=0.5}


## Campus Policing {background-image="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240425164732-30-university-campus-protests-unf.jpg?q=w_1480,c_fill" background-opacity=0.5}


## Prisons {background-image="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/shutterstock_365427041_crop.jpg" background-opacity=0.5}

::: {.incremental}

  - In 2021, Black Americans were imprisoned at 5.0 times the rate of whites, while American Indians and Latinx people were imprisoned at 4.2 times and 2.4 times the white rate, respectively ([The Sentencing Project](https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/one-in-five-ending-racial-inequity-in-incarceration/), 2023)

  - One in five Black men born in 2001 is likely to experience imprisonment within their lifetime, a decline from one in three for those born in 1981. Pushback from policymakers threatens further progress in reducing racial inequity in incarceration.
