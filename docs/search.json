Wells-Barnett\n\n\nWe use the term “Data Wells” to describe how we practice the identification, input, and storage of what can be termed as critical insights data, or CIDs.\nWe use information in databases in four ways:\n\nstudying problems in the quantification of historical information across various axes: time, social constructs, and/or systemic issues,\ndata identification and wrangling,\ndata analysis and communication, and\nmodeling abstract inquiries.\n\nWe begin our analysis with Ida B. Wells-Barnett’s organization and analysis of lynching.\nWe describe “Data Wells” of U.S. state violence using quantitative history as a frame."

    "text": "Ida B. Wells-Barnett on lynching\n\nPersonal experience. In 1892, a close friend of Ida B. Wells-Barnett was lynched. Wells-Barnett, a known activist, community organizer, and journalist, would generate quantitative indicators of lynching as state violence.\n\n\n\nIntuition and method. Like many Black communities at the time and other allies, Wells-Barnett acknowledged both the personal (micro) social forces of racism and the systemic (macro) nature of white racial violence. In this case, this violence was expressed through the practice of lynching.\n\n\n\n\nImpact. Wells-Barnett’s databases, and the use of number and quantification have a profound impact on the current view of state-sponsored racial violence."
