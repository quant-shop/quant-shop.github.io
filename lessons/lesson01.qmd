## The Quantitative Histories Workshop Model

### Prep

Code and data prep should follow the [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510){target="_blank"} model.

### Analysis

Analyses can be done in any software program and a clear summary of steps should be included.

### Reporting

All reports should be generated using an .RMarkdown.

### Case study

To explore this 3-step model, we will use a case study as found in [Lesson 02]().
