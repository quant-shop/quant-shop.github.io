we are a network of collaborative projects. 

we use interdisciplinary perspectives and computational tools to educate ourselves about history.

at our core, we are a computational studies, curriculum, and software development lab. specifically, we study historical events to support our group--and others--in learning about in/justice and futurity. throughout this process, we explore and discuss how to act on our new knowledge. 

we strive to maintain honest applications of multiple critical theories with honest and care, yet we remain mindful of the potential harms of computational and modeling tools when studying communities and groups. however, at the same time, we are excited about how quantitative methods and tools can inform how we respond to injustice. 

our work inspires our members to develop community-centered, near-peer research projects and user groups. in these groups, users engage with other members of their teams by setting shared learning goals and engage in interdisciplinary projects about pressing questions. we then hold workshops to invite the public into our processes of learning, modeling, and data explorations.

our workshop is inspired by the legacy of the great, late Bob Moses, founder of the [Algebra Project](https://www.algebra.org){target="_blank"}.
