We quantify history and the social sciences to learn about in/justice & futurity.

Our lab works to identify sources of information for engagement and analysis across historical, contemporary, and future-oriented perspectives. These data are meant to support critical quantitative analyses. Data sources, software programs, and public code are outlined below.
