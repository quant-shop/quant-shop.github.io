## Principles of Reconstruction

::: {.incremental}

  - Du Bois' (1935) [Black Reconstruction: An Essay Toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880](https://www.loa.org/books/698-black-reconstruction/) offers an alternative assessment of the post-Civil War period in the United States.
  
  - Democracy provided a new narrative at the time to examine African American progress post enslavement, and it continued to challenge long-standing narratives about racial hierarchy.
  
  - Recently, notable scholars, such as Gloria Ladson-Billings, return to the importance of narratives of *democracy* in relation to the promise and perils of education and society broadly, while also highlighting the limits of liberalism.

## A focus on "Data Wells": [*Data*]{style="color:darkgreen;"} + Ida B. [*Wells*]{style="color:darkgreen;"}-Barnett

::: {.incremental}

  - We use the term "[Data Wells]{style="color:darkgreen;"}" to describe how we practice the identification, input, and storage of what can be termed as critical insights data, or CIDs.
  
  - We use information in databases in four ways: 
  
    (1) studying problems in the [quantification of historical information]{style="color:red;"} across various axes: time, social constructs, and/or systemic issues, 
    
    (2) data [identification]{style="color:red;"} and [wrangling]{style="color:red;"}, 
    
    (3) data [analysis]{style="color:red;"} and [communication]{style="color:red;"}, and 
    
    (4) [modeling]{style="color:red;"} abstract inquiries.
  
  - We begin our analysis with Ida B. Wells-Barnett's organization and analysis of lynching.
  
  - We describe "Data Wells" of U.S. state violence using quantitative history as a frame.

## Quantitative history

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

  - Quantitative history considers methods and approaches to artifacts as data and information.
  
  - Historians like Pierre Chanu (text to right) are centered in traditional texts; more perspectives are uncovering troubling practices with regard to race[^chanu].
  
  - Despite long-standing critiques, there are [few critical dimensions]{style="color:orange;"} in [quantitative history] narratives.

## Racialization and U.S. State Violence

Today, we will discuss race and racialization in *data wells* of state sponsored violence:

. . .

  - Lynching 

. . .

  - Policing

. . .

  - Prisons

## Ida B. Wells-Barnett on lynching

  - **Personal experience**. In 1892, a close friend of Ida B. Wells-Barnett was lynched. Wells-Barnett, a known activist, community organizer, and journalist, would generate quantitative indicators of lynching as state violence.

. . .

  - **Intuition and method**. Like many Black communities at the time and other allies, Wells-Barnett acknowledged both the personal (micro) social forces of racism and the systemic (macro) nature of white racial violence. In this case, this violence was expressed through the practice of lynching.

. . .

  - **Impact**. Wells-Barnett's databases, and the use of number and quantification have a profound impact on the current view of state-sponsored racial violence.

## Lynching

Caitlin Pollock has created [software](https://redrecord.cmjpollock.com/) based on a series of extracted data from Wells-Barnett's work. Although the data provides for quick loading and analysis, it does require some data wrangling.

## Racism vs. Anti-Blackness {background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Blackboard.png?20200731124623" background-opacity=0.5}

In a 2020 NY Times article, kihana miraya ross chronicles the realities of anti-Blackness. [ross (2020)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/george-floyd-anti-blackness.html) deals with the related but differing functions of racism and anti-Blackness.

::: {.incremental}

  - ross notes that “'racism' fails to fully capture what black people in this country are facing."
  
  - ross continues by noting that "Anti-blackness is one way some black scholars have articulated what it means to be marked as black in an anti-black world."
  
  - Broadly, ross defines anti-Blackness as society's inability to recognize Black people's humanity.
