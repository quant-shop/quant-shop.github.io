## A focus on "Data Wells": [*Data*]{style="color:darkgreen;"} + Ida B. [*Wells*]{style="color:darkgreen;"}-Barnett

::: {.incremental}

  - We use the term "[Data Wells]{style="color:darkgreen;"}" to describe how we practice the identification, input, and storage of what can be termed as critical insights data, or CIDs.
  
  - We use information in databases in four ways: 
  
    (1) studying problems in the [quantification of historical information]{style="color:red;"} across various axes: time, social constructs, and/or systemic issues, 
    
    (2) data [identification]{style="color:red;"} and [wrangling]{style="color:red;"}, 
    
    (3) data [analysis]{style="color:red;"} and [communication]{style="color:red;"}, and 
    
    (4) [modeling]{style="color:red;"} abstract inquiries.
  
  - We begin our analysis with Ida B. Wells-Barnett's organization and analysis of lynching.
  
  - We describe "Data Wells" of U.S. state violence using quantitative history as a frame.

## On the Principles of Reconstruction

::: {.incremental}

  - Du Bois' (1935) [Black Reconstruction: An Essay Toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880](https://www.loa.org/books/698-black-reconstruction/) offers an alternative assessment of the post-Civil War period in the United States.
  
  - Democracy provided a new narrative at the time to examine African American progress post enslavement, and it continued to challenge long-standing narratives about racial hierarchy.
  
  - Recently, notable scholars, such as Gloria Ladson-Billings, return to the importance of narratives of *democracy* in relation to the promise and perils of education and society broadly, while also highlighting the limits of liberalism.

## Quantitative history

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

  - Quantitative history considers methods and approaches to artifacts as data and information.
  
  - Historians like Pierre Chanu (text to right) are centered in traditional texts; more perspectives are uncovering troubling practices with regard to race[^chanu].
  
  - Despite long-standing critiques, there are [few critical dimensions]{style="color:orange;"} in [quantitative history] narratives.

## Racialization and U.S. State Violence

Today, we will discuss race and racialization in *data wells* of state sponsored violence:

. . .

  - Lynching. Framing historical incidents and conceptualizing the contemporary formations of lynching.

. . .

  - Policing. Understanding the role of policing in relation to both lynching and prisons.

. . .

  - Prisons. Identifying narratives around prison populations and racialization.

## Lynching

Caitlin Pollock developed [maps](https://redrecord.cmjpollock.com/) using data extracted from Wells-Barnett's work. Although the data provides for quick loading and analysis, it does require some data wrangling and other questions remain. We build on this data to examine the social implications of cartography and map making.

## Histories of police violence

  - Ku Klux Klan origin and membership
  
  - *American Policing: Protect Private Property, Not People*, by David Todd
  
  - Cop Cities (see, Atlanta) and the militarization of local police

## Media Framing

In *Race and Police Brutality: The Importance of Media Framing* (Fridkin, 2017) the authors discuss how media framing can affect the audience's perception of situations. Here, we disucss racialization.

## Anlayzing policing data

::: {.incremental}

  - Since 2015, the Washington Post has collected [data on fatal police interactions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/) in the United States. This effort has proven to be one useful tool for our historical analysis.
  
  - We expanded the fatal police shootings database by adding new variables and flags (e.g., confederate state, population) to help assess interrelations among and between variables.

  - Our analyses have resulted in a host of questions in relation to the presence of state violence.

## Policing on college campuses

![Timeline of campus policing](campus-policing-timeline.jpg){width=25%}

## Policing on college campuses

::: {.incremental}

  - Background
  
    - First recorded instance of police officers on Yale University’s campus in 1894
    
    - An overwhelming 95% of college campuses employ campus police officers (Davis, 2023)

    - Black student voices continue to elevate issues with campus policing (Davis, 2023)

  - Policing of Black bodies
  
    - The history of institutionalized punishment and the legitimization of force against Black bodies is ingrained in the fabric of American history (Hattery & Smith, 2017).
    
    - Case Law: 1938 - *Missouri ex rel.--Gaines vs. Canada* (Ware, 2008); 1983 - *Boyle v. Torres* (Warner, Norcross, & Judd, 2015)
    
    - Mental health challenges
    
  - Safety through legislation?
  
    - Clergy Act of 1990
    
    - 2020 - 119 Bills introduced across 33 states addresing campus safety (Villalobos, 2020)
    
    - Mounting state and local legislation authorizing firearms on college campuses.
    
    - Need for consensus on protection versus imperilment

## Racism vs. Anti-Blackness {background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Blackboard.png?20200731124623" background-opacity=0.5}

In a 2020 NY Times article, kihana miraya ross chronicles the realities of anti-Blackness. [ross (2020)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/george-floyd-anti-blackness.html) deals with the related but differing functions of racism and anti-Blackness.

::: {.incremental}

  - ross notes that “'racism' fails to fully capture what black people in this country are facing."
  
  - ross continues by noting that "Anti-blackness is one way some black scholars have articulated what it means to be marked as black in an anti-black world."
  
  - Broadly, ross defines anti-Blackness as society's inability to recognize Black people's humanity.

## Hypothesis 1: Peaks in research occur within some key historical interval $(t_1, t_2)$.

## Hypothesis 2: These intervals are lag models of broader system searches $(t_1, t_2)$.

# Broad Implications

  - K-12 teaching and learning
  
    - This also exposes students to a diversity of problems and methods to solve those problems.

  - Computationally-focused research and training in higher education
  
    - Provides an equitable pathway and entry into "high information, high density" conversations.
    
  - Industry and professional organizations
