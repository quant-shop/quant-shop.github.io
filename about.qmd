We make use of modern computational tools and software to learn about and respond to local and global issues of in/justice. Our work empowers our members to set up community-centered, near-peer user groups. In these groups, individuals and organizations engage with our team and set up small learning communities to sustain longer term engagement in their local contexts.

we quantify history and the social sciences to learn about in/justice & futurity.
