    "text": "Ida B. Wells-Barnett on lynching\n\nPersonal experience. In 1892, a close friend of Ida B. Wells-Barnett was lynched. Wells-Barnett, a known activist, community organizer, and journalist, would generate quantitative indicators of lynching as state violence.\n\n\n\nIntuition and method. Like many Black communities at the time and other allies, Wells-Barnett acknowledged both the personal (micro) social forces of racism and the systemic (macro) nature of white racial violence. In this case, this violence was expressed through the practice of lynching.\n\n\n\n\nImpact. Wells-Barnett’s databases, and the use of number and quantification have a profound impact on the current view of state-sponsored racial violence."
