We quantify history and the social sciences to learn about in/justice & futurity.

Our lab works with and sources information and data for engagement and analysis using software programs to support historical, contemporary, and future-oriented perspectives. These data are meant to support critical quantitative analyses. Data sources, software programs, and public code are outlined below.
